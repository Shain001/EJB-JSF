# AUSPrintings Management System

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a Java EE system to help AUSPrings Pty Ltd mange their clients and transactions. The objective is to seperate two different roles, i.e. `Admin` and `Normal User` for AUSPrintings employees. While admins can mange/view all clients, allocate clients to specific users and delete normal users, the normal users can only mange/view their own clients. Also, a Angular-built page allows users to mange the industries that the company can serve for.
